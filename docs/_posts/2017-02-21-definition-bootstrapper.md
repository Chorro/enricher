The bootstrapper is the mechanism that is used to load stream config into enricher. You can configure the boostrapper class on the config file, using `bootstrapper.classname` property. Currently, the enricher has two bootstrappers:
http://wizzie-io.github.io/enricher/bootstrapper/file-bootstrapper.html
* [FileBootstrapper](http://wizzie-io.github.io/enricher/bootstrapper/file-bootstrapper.html)
* [KafkaBootstrapper](http://wizzie-io.github.io/enricher/bootstrapper/kafka-bootstrapper.html)

If you want you can extend the bootstrappers using the [ThreadBootstrapper](https://github.com/wizzie-io/enricher/blob/master/service/src/main/java/io/wizzie/ks/enricher/builder/bootstrap/ThreadBootstrapper.java) abstract class. 

On this class you need to implement two methods:

```void init(Builder builder, Config config, MetricsManager metricsManager) throws Exception;```

* To initialize update the stream config you need to use the method `updateStreamConfig(...)` from Builder class.

```public void run()```
 
* You only need implemented it, if you want to update the stream config continuously.

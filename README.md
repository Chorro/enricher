# Enricher

Enricher is a stream enriching engine based of Kafka Streams. Enricher does joins (streams and tables) end enrichment with any data store system that you define. You only need to define a JSON stream where you specify the joiners and enrichers to use and your enrichment query.

Enricher offers us: scalability, fault tolerance, back-preassure and full Kafka integration ... [Try it now!!](https://wizzie.io/enricher/getting/base-tutorial.html)
